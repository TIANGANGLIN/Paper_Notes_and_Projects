# Modelling of Pedestrian Groups and Application to Group Recognition

## Summary

## Notes
Gave a dataset: http://www.irc.atr.jp/sets/groups/
[20] has shown that two pedestrians whos are socially interacting in a walking group tend to have a stable abreast formation, i.e. they walk in such a way that the direction of movement is perpendicular to the direction towards the partner. 
[7] has analysis their walking goal and interaction partner in their field of view, and this was compared and validated against empirical observations of pedestrian groups.

# A Location-Velocity-Temporal Attention LSTM Model for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction

## Summary
Most of the current advanced trajectory prediction methods incorporate context information such as pedestrian neighbourhood, labelled static obstacles, and the background scene into the trajectory prediction process. In contrast to these methods which require rich contexts, the method in our paper focuses on predicting a pedestrian’s future trajectory using his/her observed part of the trajectory
only. 
这篇文章对当前轨迹预测的进展分析的很好，
这里并不考虑领域或场景信息，对于ADAS无人驾驶应用车辆这些计算资源有限的应用，可能更好。
采用location-LSTM 和 velocity-LSTM及时间注意力机制，这里仅仅考虑Person of Interest，不需要场景信息和相邻的轨迹信息。所以没有[11],[22],[23]的池化层。

## 时间注意力机制
The temporal attention mechanism captures the relationships between a time step of the prediction phase and different time steps of the observed part of the input trajectory.
